	<div class="underline font-bold text-base">Terms of Service</div>
	<div class="font-bold">Effective Date: March 1 2024</div>
	<div>
		2 You Enterprise, LLC DBA Trip 2 There (RSS, we, us or our) operates the RDS mobile application
		and the www.trip2there.com website (collectively, the Services). This privacy policy (Privacy
		Policy) describes the types of information that we (and, as applicable, our service providers on
		our behalf) may collect or you may provide when you download, install, register with, access or
		use the Services. This Privacy Policy also describes our practices for collecting, using,
		disclosing, and maintaining such information. Our Services are subject to the Restaurant
		Delivery Provider Agreement (the Agreement), and this Privacy Policy is an integral part of that
		Agreement. Prices listed for delivery may be higher than prices listed inside the restaurant.
	</div>

	<div>
		This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect or you provide via the Services and
		in email and other electronic communications via the Services. This Privacy Policy does not
		apply to information we collect offline or that you provide to third-party websites you may
		access through the Services (see Third-Party Links section below). These third parties may have
		their own privacy policies, which govern how information is collected and used, and we encourage
		you to read the policies before providing information on or through them.
	</div>

	<div>
		Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding
		your information and how we will treat it. Along with this Privacy Policy, please read our Terms
		of Use, which are hereby incorporated and made part of this Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE
		WITH OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, REGISTER WITH, ACCESS OR USE THE
		SERVICES. By downloading, registering with, accessing or using the Services, you agree to the
		terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
	</div>

	<div class="font-bold">Changes to This Privacy Policy.</div>
	<div>
		We reserve the right to change or replace this Privacy Policy at our sole discretion at any time
		and we encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. If we make material changes to
		this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy in the Services and provide notice
		to you that the Privacy Policy has been updated via email or in-Services alert. Any changes to
		the Privacy Policy will become effective upon posting of the revised policy. Your continued use
		of the Services following the posting of changes constitutes your agreement to such changes.
	</div>

	<div class="font-bold">Information We Collect and How We Collect It.</div>
	<div>
		We may collect information from and about the Services when you provide it to us or
		automatically while you use the Services and, with your permission, when you are not using the
		Services. For example, with your permission we may access your location even if the Services are
		not being actively used. Our goal in collecting information is to provide and improve our
		Services and services, to administer your use of the Services, and to enable you to enjoy and
		easily navigate our Services.
	</div>

	<div class="font-bold">
		Information You Provide via the Services; Account Information; Payment Information.
	</div>
	<div>
		Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person.
		When you download, register with, or use the Services, you will be required to register an
		account and provide certain personal information, including your name (first and last), your
		email address, an account password, your delivery address, your billing address and payment
		information. We will then use your account information to provide you with the Services. For
		example, when you submit an order for restaurant delivery services, we will communicate a
		confirmation of your order using the email address located in your account. Later, when you
		return to our Services to submit new, or additional, orders, we will have your account
		information on file so you wont be required to manually enter all your information again. Each
		time you place an order for restaurant delivery services, we will maintain a record of your
		order. This way, when you've customized an order with a favorite restaurant you can submit that
		order again and again without having to reenter all the detailed information. When you download
		the Services, we will request permission to send you push notifications related to the Services.
		See Changes in Personal Information; Opt-Out; Your Choices section below to learn more about how
		to change the push notification preferences. You may be offered the opportunity to have one of
		our representatives contact you to provide you additional information about our Services or
		services (e.g., if you select ? button in the Services or if we request feedback about the
		Services). We also may collect information you provide to us through your device's camera. If
		you are locked out of your account, you may visit the website at www.takeout2unow.com to reset
		your password. By initiating any activity or transaction that uses payment information in the
		Services, for example by placing an order for delivery, you consent to providing your financial
		information to us and our service providers processing the transaction to the extent required to
		provide the payment services to you. When you interact with us through various social media, for
		example, by visiting our Facebook or Instagram page, we may collect information including your
		email address, location and other biographical information. The information we receive from your
		social network depends on your privacy settings. Where the mobile application has connectivity
		to social media via a plug-in, you should always review, and, if you prefer, adjust your privacy
		settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Services.
	</div>

	<div class="font-bold">AutomaticCollection.</div>
	<div>
		When you download, register with, or use the Services, the Services may use technologies to
		automatically collect usage information (e.g., your use of features of the Services), location
		information (real-time information about the location of your device you're using to access the
		Services) and device information (e.g., device type, mobile network information, unique device
		identifier, operating system, browser type, application version). This information is sometimes
		called traffic data and helps us improve and customize the Services. This information is
		generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as an identifiable person, we will
		treat it as personal information.
	</div>

	<div class="font-bold">Location Information.</div>
	<div>
		In order to provide you with our Services, we are required to receive or infer information about
		your location from a variety of sources. For example, we may use your IP address to identify
		your general location or we may receive more precise location data from your mobile device (such
		as via GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points). We save your location when you
		submit a request for delivery to a specific location. In addition to using your location in
		order to provide the Services, we may use location data to analyze certain information, and to
		improve our Services and relevance of the information we provide to you via the Services. Please
		note that if you do not share your location information then we will not be able to provide the
		Services to you.
	</div>

	<div class="font-bold">Technologies Used to Automatically Collect Information.</div>
	<div>
		Technologies we use on the Services to collect traffic data, directly or through our service
		providers, may include cookies (data files placed on your mobile device used to access the
		Services), analytics software (e.g., Google Analytics) and pixel tags (transparent graphic
		image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an email,
		which indicates that a page or email has been viewed). A pixel tag may tell your browser to get
		content from another server. We, or our service providers, may place cookies or similar files on
		your mobile device used to access the Services for security purposes, to facilitate Services
		navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting the Services. It may be possible to
		refuse to accept mobile cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device.
		However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access all or parts of our Services and
		some of our feature and services on the Services may not operate as intended.
	</div>

	<div class="font-bold">Third-Party Information Collection; Cross-Device Collection.</div>
	<div>
		When you use the Services, certain third parties may use automatic information collection
		technologies to collect information about you or your device. These third parties may include
		your mobile service provider, your mobile device manufacturer, and third parties engaged by us
		to host or store information, including information obtained through the Services, or provide
		certain services for us, including promotional campaigns, fulfillment and loyalty/rewards
		programs. These third parties may use tracking technologies to collect information from you when
		you use the Services. The information they collect may be associated with your personal
		information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online
		activities over time and across different websites, apps, or other online services websites. We
		do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have
		any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the
		responsible provider directly.
	</div>

	<div class="font-bold">How We Use Information Collected From You.</div>

	<div>
		We use information we collect about you or you provide to us, including any personal
		information, to provide you with the Services and its contents, and to provide other
		information, products, offers or services you request from us, fulfill any other purpose for
		which you provide such information, to communicate with you about our Services, provide offers
		and promotions to you, give you notice about our offers and promotions, notify you when Services
		updates are available, and of any changes to any of our services we offer or provide through the
		Services. The usage information helps us improve our Services and to deliver a better and more
		personalized experience by enabling us to estimate our audience size and usage patterns, store
		information about your preferences and recognize you when you use the Services. We also use
		location information to determine offers available near you and to provide location-based
		offers.
	</div>

	<div class="font-bold">Disclosure of Your Information.</div>
	<div>
		We may use or disclose your information, including personal information, to our third-parties to
		protect the security and integrity of the Services, to correct technical problems and
		malfunctions on the Services, to technically process your information, to fulfill our offers,
		promotions and coupons, to Data Dreamers so that it may provide services to you, and/or to take
		precautions against liability. We may also provide your information to our service providers who
		provide services on our behalf (e.g., our analytics provider and payment processor). We reserve
		the right to transfer any information we have about you in connection with a sale, merger,
		consolidation, change in control, transfer of assets, reorganization or liquidation of our
		business. We reserve the right to disclose any personal information as needed if that
		information is requested by law enforcement agencies or if we are required to do so by law,
		treaty, regulation, subpoena, court order, or by a government entity. We also may disclose your
		personal information to third parties if we have reason to believe that disclosing such
		information is necessary to conduct investigations of possible breaches of law, to cooperate in
		any legal investigation, or to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may
		be violating any agreement with us.
	</div>

	<div class="font-bold">Do-Not-Track Requests; Third-Party Tracking.</div>
	<div>
		Unless your browser or device settings are configured to make your Services activities and
		publicly available information about your Services activities (such as traffic data described
		above) invisible to usage analytics tools, we do not presently have the capability to omit you
		from usage analytics to the extent your browser only sends a do not track message and does not
		otherwise screen you from tracking without any action on our part. Third parties, other than our
		service providers, do not have authorization from us to track which websites, apps, or other
		online services you visit prior to and after visiting the Services. Please note, however, that
		we cannot control third-party tracking and there may be some third-party tracking that occurs
		without our consent or knowledge.
	</div>

	<div class="font-bold">Changes in Personal Information; Opt-Out; Your Choices.</div>
	<div>
		If you need to correct, update, or delete your personal information, please contact us at any
		time by sending an email to takeout2unow@gmail.com. Please note that we may not be able to
		correct or update your personal information previously provided to us by third parties. You can
		also choose to delete your account.
	</div>

	<div class="font-bold">Opt-Out.</div>
	<div>
		If you receive any promotional email communication from us, you will be given the option to
		unsubscribe from receiving further email communications at any time. Your option not to receive
		promotional and marketing material will not preclude us from accessing and viewing your personal
		information in the course of maintaining and improving the Services. Push Notifications: If you
		do not want to receive push notifications from us, you may opt out of receiving these when you
		first launch the Services or at a later stage by using the settings on your mobile device.
	</div>
	<div class="font-bold">Cookies:</div>
	<div>
		You can set your browser to refuse all or some cookies or alert you when cookies are being sent.
		If you disable or refuse cookies or block the use of other technologies, some parts of the
		Services may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
	</div>

	<div class="font-bold">Location:</div>
	<div>
		You can choose whether or not to allow the Services to collect and use real-time information
		about your device's location through your device's settings, but we will not be able to make
		deliveries to you without a delivery address. You can manage these preferences when the Services
		is first launched or at a later stage by using the setting on your mobile device. If you block
		the use of location information, an essential part of the Services will be inaccessible and will
		not function properly. For example, if you do not allow the Services access to your location on
		your phone, then we will not be able to assist you in specifying your delivery address. We may
		contact you periodically to make you aware of these limitations.
	</div>
	<div class="font-bold">Camera:</div>
	<div>
		You can choose whether or not to allow the Services to collect information about your device's
		camera and photos through your device's settings. You can manage these preferences when the
		Services is first launched or at a later stage by using the setting on your mobile device. If
		you block the use of camera or photos, an essential part of the Services will be inaccessible
		and will not function properly. For example, if you do not allow the Services access to the
		camera on your phone, then we will not be able to use your images to further define your
		delivery location. We may contact you periodically to make you aware of these limitations.
	</div>
	<div class="font-bold">Security.</div>
	<div>
		We take reasonable security precautions to protect the personal information that you choose to
		provide. Although guaranteed security does not exist on the internet or offline, we make
		commercially reasonable efforts to handle such information consistent with this Privacy Policy
		and applicable laws. Due to the design of the internet and other factors outside our control, we
		cannot guarantee communications between you and our servers will be free from unauthorized
		access by third parties.
	</div>

	<div class="font-bold">Third-Party Links.</div>
	<div>
		The Services may contain links to third-party websites that are not controlled by us. For
		example, you may find a link to visit a GoogleMaps website or similar map website if the
		Services's map feature is not registering and you are within a certain distance of an offer
		location. These links are made available to you as a convenience, and you agree to use these
		links at your own risk. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy policies and
		practices or content of such third-party sites. This Privacy Policy only applies to information
		we collect from you while you are using the Services. If you navigate to a third-party website
		from the Services, we encourage you to review and become familiar with such third-party
		website's privacy policy and statements.
	</div>

	<div class="font-bold">Children.</div>
	<div>
		The Services are intended for adults and not intended for children in the United States under 13
		years of age, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13.
		If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without
		verification of parental consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as
		possible. If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide any personal information to us.
		If you believe we might have any information from or about children under 13, please contact us
		at takeout2unow@gmail.com.
	</div>

	<div class="font-bold">Notice to Residents of Countries Outside the United States.</div>
	<div>
		We are headquartered in the United States. Personal information may be accessed or used by us or
		transferred to us in the United States or to our affiliates, business partners, or service
		providers elsewhere in the world. If you are located outside the United States, be advised that
		any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States and
		that, by submitting information to us, you explicitly authorize its transfer and storage within
		the United States. We will treat the personal information subject to this Privacy Policy
		according to this Privacy Policy regardless of where it is processed or stored.
